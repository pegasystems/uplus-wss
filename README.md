# UPlus WSS Static files

The Uplus application is a typical web application built as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) with one of the latest framework (Vue.js). It showcases how a Single Page Application (SPA) can be integrated with the Pega Platform around Mashup, Co-Browse, Pega chat and Knowledge Management as well as with Customer Decision Hub for offers and realtime streams. It demonstrates how these technologies can be integrated with a typical consumer grade web application to provide a seamingless experience and interaction.
